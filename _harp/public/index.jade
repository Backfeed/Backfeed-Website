                    p Backfeed’s infrastructure comprises decentralized management tools, equity-sharing schemes, crowdsourcing mechanisms, and instruments for the collaborative evaluation and curation of content.
                    p The Backfeed protocol can fuel a variety of ventures, including decentralized journalism, insurance, ride-sharing applications and any other enterprise that would benefit from the decentralized, indirect coordination of large groups of individuals.
                    p Our goal is to enable the bootstrapping of decentralized organizations on top of the blockchain as easily as one would deploy a website today.
