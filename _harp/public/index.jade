                        p The Backfeed protocol can fuel a variety of applications, including decentralized journalism, decentralized insurance, decentralized ride-sharing applications and any other enterprise that would benefit from  the decentralized, indirect coordination of large groups of individuals.
                        p With Backfeed, it will soon be possible to bootstrap decentralized organisations on top of the blockchain as easy as one would deploy a website today.
